    First off, if you haven't read my first article about the Google October 4th event, you should read that first <a href="./GoogleEventPredictions" class="link link--article">here</a>. Now that you have read it, the following will hopefully make sense.

<p>
    Google officially confirmed that there will be an event on October 4th, and strongly hinted at a new piece of hardware. You can see this in the official videos embedded below but also at <a href="https://madeby.google.com" class="link link--article">madeby.google.com</a>. The first video is the one released by Google's official YouTube Channel and the second one is by Google Australia, pretty strange that they are different in my opinion.

    Some pricing information leaked and its starting to look like the small Pixel phone is going to be $649 for the 32GB base model. This puts these phones right up next to iPhones and some Samsung models like the Note 7.

    Google also filed a patent for a VR headset, which is most likely the Daydream View headset that might sell for $80, no leaks yet as to if this will be bundled with the phones or not. I really hope they come bundled, but if they don't I still might get it when I get the phone. All this put together I might be spending close to $1,000 on a phone and VR headset come October. ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜¢

    Oh and also Allo is now out! Its pretty great but without SMS functionality its not going to be as big in the US.
