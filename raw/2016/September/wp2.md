This weekend I didn't really work on too many projects. I was sick Friday evening and most of Saturday also with a really bad headache/migraine. But most of Saturday and Sunday I spent learning about building applications with React in ES2015. Sunday morning I recorded a video code along, the first of maybe a few such videos. You can find the video on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJvfPNCnRnc" >here</a>[^1].

Most of the rest of the weekend was spent looking into Vue.js which I have tried learning before also but I think I want to build a small application with it as a simple point of reference about the basics of the framework.

Also for future reference here are the projects I want to work on in the soon:

* Expense Manager
* Water intake tracker
* Meal manager/tracker/diary
* Task manager

#### Footnotes:
[^1]: Note! The audio is really bad and I made several mistakes recording it, but at least I can learn about that in the future. If you have any feedback about how to improve my recordings reach out to me, I would love to learn more!
