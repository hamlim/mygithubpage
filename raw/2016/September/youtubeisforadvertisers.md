In case you haven't heard, YouTube is yet again disappointing the creators on their site through a huge automated move that recently started. As of a week ago large YouTube creators started to report that their videos were being demonetized because the content of the videos wasn't advertiser-friendly.

A lot of creators have talked about this issue, some supporting it but a large majority disagreeing with the move and complaining that a move like this is censorship. I have one small issue with this argument, these creators believe that YouTube as a platform is for *them*.

YouTube is not, and I repeat, **NOT** for the creators, its for the advertisers. The Advertisers are the major stakeholder of the platform. Sure the creators are a group of stakeholders but their share of the benefits is tiny compared to that of the Advertisers.
