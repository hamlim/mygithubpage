    September has been one of my most productive months in a while. I have been grinding away at work, writing more blog posts in this month than any other month I have been blogging, and also worked on more of my projects than any other month basically.
</p>
#### Work:
<p>
    At work I have been helping to launch the Wayfair Registry experience, I joined the team fairly late on but helped across the entire registry functionality across PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also been helping to optimize the landing pages so they load faster and work better for more devices and users.
</p>
#### Blogging:
<p>
    This month alone I published <mark>17</mark> blog posts across different areas, if you missed any you can find them  <a href="/Posts/2016/September/" data-css-link-article>here</a>. I feel like I have really started a great habit of writing more.
</p>
#### Projects:
<p>
    In the past month I have rebuilt my personal website, my portfolio website, and also launched a few small side projects. I plan to continue this pace on into October and the rest of the year.
