    If you didn't know, Google had a huge event on <a href="./October4th" data-css-link-article>October 4th</a> announcing their new Pixel Phones, Daydream Viewer, Google Home, Google WiFi, and Google Assistant. For many reasons this is the largest Google Event yet. Especially when considering the amount of hardware Google has announced and is releasing.
</p>
<p>
    Of course pre-orders for the phones opened up right in the middle of the announcement and as soon as it did I pre-ordered one. I got the Very Silver 128GB Pixel XL. I definitely feel like the price was too much for a phone and noted that on twitter.

    There are two main reasons why I decided to buy the phone, the first is the camera. The photos and video samples that I have seen from this phone are simply amazing, they are 10 times better than any other camera I have used on a phone or not.
</p>
<p>
    The second reason I decided to get this phone is because of Google Assistant, which I truly believe to be something that can be quite an amazing product and experience if Google properly develops it. Sure right now it is no more than a simple Google search bot, but I see this product growing to be something close to what we saw with the AI's in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/" data-css-link-article>her</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I plan on doing a complete review of the phone as soon as I get my hands on it with a ton of photo samples of it and some video samples with it as well. So stay tuned for that!
</p>
<p>
    Feel free to reach out to me and let me know if you plan on buying a Pixel phone, or if you pre-ordered one as well, I would love to know what kind you went for!
</p>
<p>
    Also I will be watching the ad for the phone every day until I get mine, I honestly think this is one of the best product ads that I have seen for a long time, mainly because of the playful attitude of it.
