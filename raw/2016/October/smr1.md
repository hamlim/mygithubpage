  I generally am not a huge fan of doing roundups on content someone else has collected, but I recently realized that if done properly the
  benefit of sharing this content is actually quite great. So for the inaugural issue of Sunday Morning Recap (name not final) I wanted to
  share some of the interesting bits of content I have found quite interesting in the past week or so.

### 1.
<p>
  The first interesting thing I stumbled upon was this blog post and chrome new tab extension from
  <a href="https://twitter.com/maccaw" data-css-link-article>Alex MacCaw</a> which can be found
  <a href="https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/life-hacks" data-css-link-article>here</a>. This chrome extension opens a new tab with a counter that
  displays your current age and actively counts up. Below is a quick capture of what it looks like in action. So if you want to stare your time flying by
  every time you open a new tab then this extension is for you!

<div class="has-video">
  <video data-css-video title="My current age" src="/assets/videos/motivate.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
</div>
### 2.
<p>
  The next thing I stumbled upon was <a href="http://www.webpackbin.com/" data-css-link-article>Webpackbin</a>, this allows developers to
  build simple little demos using Webpack in the browser. This is basically the same as CodePen and JSbin except allowing you to build with
  webpack and install loaders from npm as well.

  What wouldn't be a roundup post this week without covering the new Star Wars trailer, check it out below!

<div class="has-video">
  <iframe data-css-video data-css-youtube src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sC9abcLLQpI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
  Thats all I have this morning, make sure to enjoy the rest of your weekend!
