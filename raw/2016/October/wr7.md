This past week was quite interesting, I had several new
project ideas and decided I wanted to clean up a bit in terms
of what projects I am actively developing and what project
ideas that I want to actively develop. This past week I started
to put some work into my new project Metal, which is really interesting
because it is bringing me back to my classes on Computer Science in
college. I think it will be an interesting project both in terms
of the learning aspect and in the building aspect.


This past week I also posted two new blog posts, both were very dry
but they served their purpose in allowing me to learn the differences and also the use cases of all the pseudo classes and elements in CSS.


I know that it is not an ideal kind of blog post on my site, so I plan on
reducing the amount of these kind of blog posts on my site and maybe moving
them to another blog that I can just move all the technical blog posts to.
This was a concept that I heard on the <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" data-css-link-article>Shop Talk Show</a>
where they talked about separating blogging concerns between your own domain (matthamlin.me) and
another domain that you also own but is set up for blogging about content that isn't personal.


I might end up doing exactly that and separate the content from here to another website
however I am still not sure if I want to do that because it already feels like I don't write
enough as it is just on this domain.


So this weekend I will be working on cleaning up the projects I am working on and posting a full list of
their state on this blog, as well as cleaning up my blog a bit and maybe moving it to React as well.
