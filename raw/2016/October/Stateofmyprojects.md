Below is a comprehensive (as much as possible) overview of all my current and past and future projects that I have either started and worked on or am looking at to build. I mostly want to do this to clear my head of all
the things I am trying to work on.

#### Past:

This first group of projects are the really old ones that I no longer work on at all and basically have abandoned.


* **PTWN: Trends aka CurrentWire aka Project Taiwan**
<ins>Don't ask me why I chose that project codename, I have no idea</ins>

This was my first major web project, it involved using the Twitter API to build a simple news curation service that anyone could go to
in order to see the top 10 tweets by the accounts I had selected by hand.


* **RPIDelivery:**

This was a project that I never fully launched, it was meant to be a simple DoorDash like solution for food delivery to
college students. The reason this never actually went anywhere was because I was simply too lazy to actually work out how to handle payments.


* **RPILMS-Redesign:**

This was an early attempt at flexing some design thinking to redesign the current learning management system used by RPI.
I never made this actually useful it simply acted like a living working prototype.


* **CampusLife**

This was an interesting idea I had about building a network of news sites for college campuses to grow the amount of knowledgeable students
and also grow the interest in student authors.


* **Email Templates**

This was a weekend project where I wanted to automate the generation of the emails I sent to employeers looking for jobs. What is really
cool about this project is that I was able to spin up a working web app around this idea. Check it out <a href="http://goexploring.today/Email-Templates/" data-css-link-article>here</a>.



#### Current:

These projects are things that I have recently worked on or have been working on within the past 6 months.

* **Dollar**

Dollar is one of my most ambitous but also one of a few "completed" projects that I have worked on. I still plan on reworking the entire application
using React and other React frameworks like Router and also Redux.


* **Bundles**

This is another one of project that I got to a state where I felt like it worked well enough to stop working on it actively. I might come back to
the idea and rebuild it with React or maybe even Vue.


* **HN-Redesign**

This project was another one off design website project similar to RPILMSRedesign above, where I simply wanted to flex some of my design thinking
as well as work on some CSS stuff as well.


* **Colors**

Colors was a simple React ES6 web app I made one afternoon to work a bit in React and also test out Now a service that allows me to spin up a simple
website just from the command line. You can check it out <a href="http://goexploring.today/colors/" data-css-link-article>here</a> but it isn't
100% always working (also will basically not work on any non-evergreen browser).


* **Boilerplate**

Boilerplate was a simple project that I made to quickly use as a base for all future projects, it is using React, Webpack and a few other things.
I recently updated it to future-boilerplate that swapped out SCSS loaders to PostCSS loaders.



#### Future:
These are the projects that I want to work on and have been sitting on for a very long time.

* **Food Tracker:**

As someone who wants to have a better understanding of my eating habits I want to track the kind of food I eat from day to day and month to month.


* **Water Tracker:**

This is basically the same thing as above but I want to track how much water I drink day to day and try to make realistic goals on how much water
I should be drinking everyday.


* **Task Manager:**

Just like every developer I want to build my own todo app with my concept of how to manage the state of tasks.


* **A better Dollar:**

Ever since I made Dollar I wish I had done it in a better way and a more extensible way. I relied on several hacks to build it and to make
it work like it does.


* **Metal:**

The goal of Metal is to learn more about the structure of the DOM and also to learn more about ES6 classes as well.



So that is a quick breakdown of all my past, current and future projects I want to work on. As time goes on I will try to update this
blog post with information about each project and add on the more projects as I have more ideas.
