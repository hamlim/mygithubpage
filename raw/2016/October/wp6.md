This weekend was mostly spent writing a few blog posts, the first of which was my overview of the <a href="/post/The-Great-CSS-Debate">great CSS debate</a> where I try to organize some of the reasons why CSS is so hotly debated right now.

In terms of work I actually did this weekend I started a new project called Metal, where I want to try and implement the DOM and HTML all using Javascript native classes. I haven't done any work on it yet but just started to get my ideas about it written down somewhere. I also started a new project called Money that will be the evolution of what Dollar was using React and a lot of ES6 stuff as well as PostCSS. So look ahead to more information about both of those projects from me later on. I also got some more work done on a large new blog post that I hope to publish by the end of <del>next</del> <ins>this</ins> week.

As always I tend to be adding more and more projects to my list and never really finishing them off, but I plan on documenting all my current projects along with their status (and maybe sharing that with others here on my blog) [^1]

This weekend I also tuned up my website a bit, played around with some different fonts. I am eyeing using Futura as my font face of choice on my website but for now I will be sticking with Work Sans. I looked at trying to use a specific Emoji font for my site but couldn't get any to work, so if you have any ideas on how to do that please let me know! For now I am simply replacing the emoji with background images [^2]

As always feel free to reach out to me via whatever channel works (see the links below in the footer) for you, telling me about your weekend or if you have any thoughts about the projects I am working on! I would als love to hear more about your weekend projects!
