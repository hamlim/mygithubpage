    This past week was really exciting and yet also ended on a kind of low note. I think I am almost completely over my cold, just a few coughs here and there left over. For most of the week I was busily working on projects at work, Wayfair Registry launched on Tuesday officially (the iOS App launched) so that was exciting to enjoy with the rest of the Registry pod.

    Sadly though some PM a few levels above the PM of the Registry pod is pulling me off that team to help another team with their project. I tried to do all I could to stay on the Registry team but sadly there is nothing I can do to stay on the team. <span data-css-emoji="cry"></span>

    I didn't too much this week outside of work besides publishing a quick <a href="./Pixel" data-css-link-article>story</a> about why I preordered the Google Pixel phone.

    This weekend I plan on working more on some side projects, especially one I have been thinking about for a long while now. I also want to work more on componentizing this blog as well. I might need to rethink how I do that in terms of file management to make it easier to manage for future edits.
