Last night I didn't get any good amount of work done at all. I ended up playing video games for about 3 hours with friends.

Maybe getting the xbox one was a bad idea. I really enjoy playing games with my friends but it also eats up a lot of my free time.

I think the core issue is lack of fundamental backbone to say no to all the distractions.

This morning I went to the grocery store and got a ton of steam bag veggies and some turkey as well as gluten free pasta. I plan on
shifting my diet to a cup of oatmeal in the morning, two soylent drinks and then some veggies for dinner. I will also start tracking my food intake today.

My plan fort today was to go for a walk, so I plan on going on that soon because its already almost 2pm. I also want to get my new blog prototype up and working.

I recently read [this excellent post on Bumpers switching to React](https://medium.com/bumpers/isnt-our-code-just-the-best-f028a78f33a9#.57vvmyv13) and I am using it
as some motivation to get my website working properly.

I am tempted to stop making content for a few weeks as I build it out. Simply to focus on building but I also have so many post ideas that I am
working on.

[] Next thing is to go for a walk, I am going to walk down Beacon street away from Boston and see what I can find.

[] Then back to work on this new blog.
