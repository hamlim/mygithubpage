Man what a day.

I told the two others on my team about switching pods the week after next, speaking of which I am switching teams
the week after next. 😄

I am pretty excited but also a bit worried about stepping into a bigger mess potentially. Either way it will be an interesting
change. I still need to tell the rest of my team about the change as well.

We also went to get sushi with a few other people, just the five of us this time but its starting to become something of a more
regular thing we do on Fridays which I really enjoy.

I posted the following on Twitter:

I think its time this weekend to hack out a simple router based solution, possibly using `react-router`. 🤷🏼‍♂️

This weekend I also plan on taking a decent walk around Brookline, maybe even up towards Alston, but who knows.

I still also need to work on the redesign of the blog also.

Oh also I got my order of the two new flavors of Soylent in the mail this morning. I probably won't have one until lunch tomorrow simply
because I am still quite full from 🍣 and I plan on having Oatmeal for breakfast. I will make sure to blog a bit about the flavor and
what I like and don't like about them though.
