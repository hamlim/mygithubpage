Ok so this is the start of my month long experiment. I woke up around 9am and rolled out of bed around 10. I subsequently
took a shower, made a bowl of oatmeal (close to 2.5 cups) then finished off breakfast with a bottle of regular flavored
soylent.

I then went through a few youtube videos and left my apartment to walk over to the grocery store. I picked up some pasta,
turkey, veggies, and also some chicken nuggets which I wasn't super proud of. I got back to my apartment, collected my mail
and then put the groceries away.

I played a short match of team death match on Battlefield 1, but wasn't really feeling it.

Its now currently 12:30 and I still need to go to Trader Joes to pick up some soy milk for coffee, and I still have a decent
amount of work to do.

For lunch I ate the chicken nuggets and topped it off with my left over soy milk.

Not having coffee in the morning really slows down my day come 3 or 4 hours later. This is one of the reasons I have a cup of coffee at 5 and one at 10:30 on normal weekdays.

My grandma has decided to send me on these random trips around Boston once a month for the next year that I am here because
she wants me to grow to love the city. I don't think I will ever really enjoy Boston, at least not the same way I do
for cities up and down the west coast. The people and culture are the two main reasons. Sure there are a lot of cool
people here but the fact of the matter is that there are more of them on the west coast in my opinion.

This is the 50th blog post using my shitty hacky solution of a dynamic renderer for these blog posts. I want to make this the last blog post to use that method before switching over so that might mean that I will not be posting a blog post yet for the next week but we shall see.

I plan on writing everyday but I think I will be storing them in the other folder while I am working there to make it a bit
easier to transition these blog posts.

I need to go out and get soy milk now, going to jump right back on getting the website up when I get back in 10 minutes.

Ok it was closer to 20 minutes but I was also able to go to the bank to get some rolls of quarters too.

I took a short break from doing some work to watch Hacksaw Ridge, I thought it was an alright movie.
Nothing too stand out but still pretty good.
