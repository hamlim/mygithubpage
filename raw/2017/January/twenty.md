Man what a day.

I told the two others on my team about switching pods the week after next, speaking of which I am switching teams
the week after next. üòÑ

I am pretty excited but also a bit worried about stepping into a bigger mess potentially. Either way it will be an interesting
change. I still need to tell the rest of my team about the change as well.

We also went to get sushi with a few other people, just the five of us this time but its starting to become something of a more
regular thing we do on Fridays which I really enjoy.

I posted the following on Twitter:

I think its time this weekend to hack out a simple router based solution, possibly using `react-router`. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This weekend I also plan on taking a decent walk around Brookline, maybe even up towards Alston, but who knows.


----

I still also need to work on the redesign of the blog also.

Oh also I got my order of the two new flavors of Soylent in the mail this morning. I probably won't have one until lunch tomorrow simply
because I am still quite full from üç£ and I plan on having Oatmeal for breakfast. I will make sure to blog a bit about the flavor and
what I like and don't like about them though.


----

I need to find some good programming music to work to, the new The XX album is alright but I don't think it suits my needs for music to
keep me working. Maybe some Kanye on shuffle though? Or Bryson Tiller or even Drake.

----

Ok I haven't chosen music yet but I think I want to hack out react router this evening for my blog. This is going to take a big amount of work
from my current setup so I think I will spin up a new git repo for this because the re-write would take way too long on its own.

I think I will start with [this react boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/formidable-react-starter)?

Ok yep going to clone that and start from there.


Eh alright after toying around with it for a while that boilerplate looks a bit above what I am looking for. I think I will just jump in my
blog-2017 repo and keep working from there.

Oh wait thats why I stopped working on that repo. It didn't support react-router and also didn't support any css preprocessing. So I guess I will just spin up a new repo. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ok well now I need to start fresh.
