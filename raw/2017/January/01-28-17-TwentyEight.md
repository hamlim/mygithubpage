Ok so this is the start of my month long experiment. I woke up around 9am and rolled out of bed around 10. I subsequently
took a shower, made a bowl of oatmeal (close to 2.5 cups) then finished off breakfast with a bottle of regular flavored
soylent.

I then went through a few youtube videos and left my apartment to walk over to the grocery store. I picked up some pasta,
turkey, veggies, and also some chicken nuggets which I wasn't super proud of. I got back to my apartment, collected my mail
and then put the groceries away.

I played a short match of team death match on Battlefield 1, but wasn't really feeling it.

Its now currently 12:30 and I still need to go to Trader Joes to pick up some soy milk for coffee, and I still have a decent
amount of work to do.

For lunch I ate the chicken nuggets and topped it off with my left over soy milk.

Not having coffee in the morning really slows down my day come 3 or 4 hours later. This is one of the reasons I have a cup of coffee at 5 and one at 10:30 on normal weekdays.
