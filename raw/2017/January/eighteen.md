So I think I have worked out the answer to my dilemma from yesterdays post. I will be able to explain it more come tomorrow when I tell my manager
what I am going to do.

Its going to be quite the change from what am doing currently but should be worth doing. I think it will open me up to
learning more and growing more personally as well as filling a bigger role over all of the frontend team at Wayfair.

Then again I could be overhyping this change. ðŸ˜„


I definitely have a lot to read up on and learn about some of the code we use in order to merge into the new role better.
