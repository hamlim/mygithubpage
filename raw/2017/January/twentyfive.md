Today was not that bad in general. Got to go out and get sushi with a few co workers and friends,
also got a decent chunk of work done on several projects.

One small note I wanted to make was that I gave in and decided to subscribe to Soylent for meals. I should
get the first delivery by Friday. Which honestly feels like a whole week away.

Other than that I don't have too much to talk about in todays post. I need to set up a meal plan this weekend, I will
make sure to write about it here on my blog and set up a simple tracking system to track food intake and also
the cost of the plan too.

I have definitely been over-eating recently so this will be important to set in stone and actually follow it. I also need to get out and walk more. This evening when I got back to my apartment it was actually light out so I should have taken advantage and gone for a walk.
