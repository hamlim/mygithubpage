So its 6:46pm and I have managed to spend more money than I normally spend in a day. Its better than yesterday maybe,
but oh well.

Building habits is a hard thing to do, I have been trying to track my spending and also my food intake. I have a feeling
if I go with a Soylent subscription I might be able to do both far easier.

I had some really delicious chicken parm for dinner but I don't think it was worth the $7.
