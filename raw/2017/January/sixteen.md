Today was an interesting day, first off unlike a lot of other people I had to work today.

This evening I plan on getting some work down on paper for a new idea I had with a friend of mine,
long story short its a platform for sharing recommendations with friends and family. Theres a lot of
social platforms out there that offer ways to share these recommendations but there is no one go-to
platform to share these.

Ideally I think of it as a Good Reads but for more than just books.

Anyway there is a lot of work to figure out what I can do to make it something that is used more than
just every once and a while.

That is what will be important, sure you can get users to share, but they need to share often.

I definitely over-ate for dinner. ðŸ¤¢

I hate the feeling of incredible boredom and also incredible need to get something done.
