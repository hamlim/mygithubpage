So I subtitled this post "The Dilemma" because I am currently facing a small dilemma in terms of facing a fork in
the road at work.

I am not sure how much I can share since I am writing my journal in public here but I have to make a difficult choice that will
impact the future of my work. I have to choose between the opportunity of the future and the value of the present.


I honestly have no idea what I want to do, I am considering talking with my current team members about what they
think about the opportunity and see what they suggest.

I will be able to write more about it on Thursday, so stay tuned for that come episode (?) 19.

    Are these blog posts episodes? In some sense they are descriptions of my days which could be seen as a form of episode. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In other news I made the wrong decision to get chocolate milk at the grocery store this evening and now am seriously regretting
buying it.

Also I am seriously considering buying an Activit√© Steel HR [see here](https://www.withings.com/us/en/products/steel-hr) it looks like a really
cool watch and offers basically the same "smart" functionality I get out of my current watch. I plan on writing up some more of my thoughts on
smart watches and wearables at large so tweet me (assuming someone is actually reading this) if you want to see that.

I also have been really jamming on The XX's new album <cite>I See You</cite>. Its really quite good and really makes me want to go back
and listen to their other works.
