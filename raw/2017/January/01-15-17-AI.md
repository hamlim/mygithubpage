## Push vs Pull AI Assistants

If you haven't watched the movie <cite>her</cite> I really recommend it, its quite an interesting story exploring a lot of different ideas
about relationships, AI's and individuality. One of the best parts of the movie was simply the AI, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, which acts
as an (almost) always on voice for the main character.

The thing is that the AI in the movie feels like something that is near impossible to actually make in the real world, or at least about
50 or more years away from becoming a reality. This is even more noticeable when you start to use either Google Assistant, Siri, or even Alexa because
all of these "AIs" are miles away from being the kind of personality of the AI from her.
