A few things to talk about this evening/episode whatever this is.

    Maybe I should start recording short audio versions of this
    episodic blog post series and just post that, or post that with
    some transcribed content as well.

1. First off I feel like I am becoming more and more like a slob, like worse than what I
was in college and high school before that. Having no one else that you live with simply
offers you the affordance of being off the hook always. This is not a good thing and I need
to fix it as soon as possible.

2. Second off, I haven't been able to work more on my website because I am lazy but also I am
spending too much time working on these posts/playing videos games/watching videos and content consumption in general.
I need to get this in order soon as well. I also really need to narrow down what content I want on
my website in the first place. Right now all I have is navigation which isn't great.

3. Third off, this goes hand and hand with the first point and that is that my eating habits are pretty
bad right now. I come back to my apartment after work and pig out on anything I have in my fridge.
I _need_ to plan out my meals every week. Make a solid plan, only buy food that fits in that plan
and track this as well. This will be a lot of up head cost but it will pay off in the long term.


4. Finally, writing these blog posts are kind of beginning to feel like something that I pressure myself
into. I have written several times about not forcing yourself to make content/things but every
single time I always try to do what I warn against.
I don't want these blog posts to be forced, I also don't want them to eat up time that I should be
using to work on bigger and better projects.

-----

I will seriously consider doing some sort of audio log version of these posts. Maybe it will just be
writing these posts out first then reading them as a recording who knows. As long as I don't have to
edit my own voice I will be fine.
