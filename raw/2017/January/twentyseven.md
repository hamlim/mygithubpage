So I didn't write yesterday. I wasn't really feeling it. I didn't get any work on my website done either.

----

Today is a different day, yet again we went on our traditional sushi Friday lunch, and yet again I ate way too
much there.

The rest of the afternoon I felt like shit because of how much Sushi I had eaten. To tell the truth I still feel
quite full.

I still haven't really realized that I need to start working on another team starting Monday. I think most of Monday
is going to be spent on transferring work over to my teammates to take on, or finishing off what I can.

Now that I am back to my apartment though I am beginning to feel a bit better. I was also pleasantly surprised to find
my food for the next month in a box labelled Soylent. Thats right, I subscribed to Soylent for 48 bottles a month. This
next month is going to be like a pilot month for me. I plan on tracking a lot of different things over this next month.

I will be tracking the following:
* Steps taken
* Water consumed
* Amount of soylent consumed
* Number of hours sleeping

I also plan on doing the following as well:
* Go on at least one walk every two days (more than just to and from work)
* Limit youtube consumption to 2 hours per day
* Limit gaming time to 4 days a week


I of course plan on tracking this on my website, I will be doing it for the first week or two in the form of
these blog posts. As soon as I have a up and working simple website prototype with my new work I plan on cutting over to
building a custom UI for it as well.

It won't be anything fancy with a UI to enter in the data but simply for showing off the information in a better format.

In the mean time I have a ton of work to get the website up and running and also to start converting all my old blog posts
to either custom components to render or to markdown files to render.

    Oh also on a small side note I read a short blog post the other day about using a Service worker to cache blog posts and
    also render out blog posts from other content. So I might look into that as a way to fake server side rendering for
    other routes.
