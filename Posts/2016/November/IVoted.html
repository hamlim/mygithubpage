            Today I voted, and I hope you did too.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other news my Tuesday was pretty plain, I am pretty excited that after today I won't have to deal with the mess that was
            this presidential election (fingers crossed). I started to wrap up work on the project I have been working on for the past
            two or three weeks now (they go by so fast I have no idea how long I have been working on this stuff). And I have been jumping
            into more cleanup tasks with my original team that I joined the company with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of me really enjoys the clean up tickets, and another part of me really hates it. I talked about this in another blog post so I
            won't talk too much about it here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work I have been working on (yet again) this website trying to narrow down a sleak style to the site and ideally trying to
            improve my process of creating new things, and also you the user's experience on this site. If you have any feedback at all feel free
            to reach out using some of the links below, or even open an Issue on the git repo for this site located <a href="https://github.com/hamlim/mygithubpage/issues">here.</a>
