            With Daylight Savings ending this weekend, it feels like I am rolling in to work now far later than I should be because of how light it is outside. I normally get in right around 6:44am, when there are only a handful of people in the office at all, let alone on my floor. I mostly finsh up some of the work I was doing in the morning before leaving to work, such as finish writing blog posts like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently put in about 9 and a half hours of work each workday and it feels pretty tiring, I wish I could work on my own side projects here and there during the workday to reinvigorate my creativity for work and for my own projects. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way people are starting to show up so time for me to start getting back to my work. Let me know if you like these kind of stream-of-consciousness posts or not. Sometimes I feel like I ramble on and get sidetracked way too often for these kind of posts to actually make sense to anyone else.
