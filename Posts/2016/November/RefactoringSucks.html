            At work this week I have been working on killing off some of our really old <code>.css</code> files that are used on a ton of random pages spread
            across all the Wayfair brands as well. This process has been really painful, mainly in testing to see if anything significantly changes
            between the current version of the site and the version on my end with the removed css file.
          </p>
          <p class="footnote-parent" id="f1">
            Cleaning up old code is terrible, but cleaning up old css is even worse. Imagine that you are actively building a new foundation for
            your home, and while you are doing that instead of cleaning up the old foundation you decide to leave it as is and simply build around it.
            Then one day down the line you realize that its probably for the best to remove the old foundation <a href="#fn1" data-footnote="Mainly for making it easier to update in the future." class="emoji-👇 fn"></a>
            and now you have an issue, what part of the foundation is still needed to keep the house up? Can you safely remove all of the old foundation or do you still need
            part of that old foundation?
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes refactoring the absolute worst. Because as a single developer out of thousands I have no idea if that file is still needed somewhere, or if
            that file is just sitting around and has no effect anymore. Doing this for CSS is even worse because its not so simple to test stylistic differences between
            two versions of a web page, especially one with so many moving parts and dynamic content as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This quick and dirty way to make sure this never happens is to remove the old files as soon as the new files take over the old contents place. However developers
            are more scared to remove files than they are of critical bugs. That is why Refactoring Sucks.
