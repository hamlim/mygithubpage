              Today I was trying to force out an article that I really wanted to write, talking about a subject that is pretty
              relevant. But I sat there trying to push out the paragraphs one after another but couldn't go any farther than one
              or two paragraphs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem is that I felt like I had this pressure to get the article out by the end of the day because of my momentum,
              or because the idea was still really fresh in my head.
            </p>
            <p data-css-lead>Don't force an idea because it is fresh in your mind.</p>
            <p>
              The worst problem is that the idea was too fresh. I was too eager to actually put it down in a file and publish it instead of
              thinking through it first and coming up with a better flow to present the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              The point is that you shouldn't really force an idea into <em>something</em> before you have a good grasp on it.
