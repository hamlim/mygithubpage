            <aside>Sidenote: I use the word React in this article to mean your favorite/preferred javascript framework, if you use Vue or something
            else the idea is the same. </aside>
            <p>
              The title of this post is a bit of a misnomer, I don't mean to tell web devs to avoid React entirely, in fact I think a modern
              web developer should be using a tool like React to help build web applications. However you probably shouldn't reach for React
              from the get go.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more time you spend grinding on building out the web app without frameworks like React allow you flesh out the core components
              of your app a lot easier and also allows you to better understand your flow of data through the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              So don't reach for React (or your favorite JS framework) at first, build it with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS first to better understand the scope
              of your application
