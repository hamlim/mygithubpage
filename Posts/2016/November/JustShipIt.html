            I am paralyzed by immensity. I have attempted to start more side projects than I can count, and for mor than 95% of them I haven't gone further than
            making a directory on my computer and copying over some half-assed work from a previous halted project and then I stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I stop there is because I preemptively lock myself into these development paradigms, ideas that lead me to focus on the build process more than
            on the creativity process. 
          </p>
          <p>
			If you are a creative you will realize that this is extremely inhibiting, as an artist if you care more about your desk than the work you do on that desk you won't really be able to create that much.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never make it past that stage on a ton of ideas because it feels like everything has to be this set-in-stone way of building out the idea or project.
            Things like thinking about a database system, or even something as basic as a build system and setup. This is all besides the point however, the main thing
            that prevents me from making any headway on these ideas is the idea that every step in the process has to be justified and backed by some common thought shared
            by the community at large. The idea that if I build a website it should follow these standards and be build using Project X because "everyone uses Project X these
            days".
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The idea that every step in the process has to be <em>justified</em> and <u>backed</u> by some common thought shared by the community at large is destructive.</p>

          <p>
            This structure that I have locked myself into with all my new projects is crushing, and deflates my enthusiasm for working on new ideas faster than any other mindset. It doesn't just happen when thinking about tooling, it happens when thinking about future goals for the project as well, this includes starting to think about monetization before I have even written a line of code towards the project. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So from here on out I plan on adding a readme for every project that I keep a running total of <strong>meaningful</strong> lines of code, as well a running total of tooling lines of code, and I hope to keep a ratio between these two numbers and I should never let the tooling number exceed 2x the meaningful lines of code. This way I will stay focused on building the project and not building out the support structure.
