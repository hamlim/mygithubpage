            I am paralyzed by immensity. I have attempted to start more side projects than I can count, and for mor than 95% of them I haven't gone further than
            making a directory on my computer and copying over some half-assed work from a previous halted project and then I stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I stop there is because I preemptively lock myself into these development paradigms, ideas that lead me to focus on the build process more than
            on the creativity process.

            I am paralyzed by immensity. I have attempted to start more side projects than I can count, and for more than 95% of them I haven't gone any further than
            to make a new folder on my computer, copy over some half-assed setup I used on the previous abandoned project and tried to go from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never make it past that stage on a ton of ideas because it feels like everything has to be this set-in-stone way of building out the idea or project.
            Things like thinking about a database system, or even something as basic as a build system and setup. This is all besides the point however, the main thing
            that prevents me from making any headway on these ideas is the idea that every step in the process has to be justified and backed by some common thought shared
            by the community at large. The idea that if I build a website it should follow these standards and be build using Project X because "everyone uses Project X these
            days".

            If every new developer learned to work like this, we would never get amazing web experiences from all kinds of individuals, we would never discover cool hacks
            that allow developers to truly immerse their visitors in the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            This structure that I have locked myself into with all my new projects is crushing, and deflates my enthusiasm for new projects faster than any other mindset.
