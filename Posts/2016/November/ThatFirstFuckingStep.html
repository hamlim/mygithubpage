              The first fucking step is the worst. It feels like climbing Mount Everest 10 times over. And yet its often the simplest part of the journey.

              The past week this article has been swirling in my head because I have been telling myself:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I can do pushups tomorrow morning.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              or
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I will brush my teeth tonight as well.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I might never actually do either of those on any repeating schedule, yet it kills me that I can't even start to try and make them habits.
              There are only two easy things involved in the process of habits, the first is thinking of a habit that you want, and the second is breaking
              your current habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't normally have an issue starting things that go on for a long time, but for the most part those are really easy to do. Things like blogging daily
              or updating my status project once a day at the beginning of this year.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Starting <em>meaningful</em> lasting habits is really difficult to do
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no one whole solution to building great long lasting habits. You just have to do it. For the most part the only way to start a habit is to start
              it now. Not today, not in a few hours, <u>now</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
              But thats not for me, I'll start tomorrow.
