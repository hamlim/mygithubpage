          <p>
            I recently made the $2,580.81 purchase of the new Macbook Pro, and I am not at all upset about it. If you know me personally you know that I am pretty
            frugal when it comes to buying basically anything, so for me that $2.6k is actually quite a large purchase. I have been looking at buying a new laptop
            for a few months now, since I have been using my Dad's old macbook pro (mid 2009 model) since Junior year of college. I wanted to buy a new macbook pro
            after graduation but I wasn't too excited about the models availible then, and also I knew from many leaks that new models were just right around the corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every leak that came out about the new Macbook Pro I got more excited, in fact I am fairly sure that a ton of other people watching the leaks probably reacted
            in the exact opposite manor than I did. With many complaining about the lack of ports and dropping the function keys for the touch bar, I was praising both
            as major achievements in the development of laptop computers. However I am a unique consumer because I don't rely on connecting many peripherals into my computer
            on a daily basis nor do I have the need for a dedicated function key row.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to buy the computer not solely for the touch bar or the USB-C port but mainly because I needed a new computer to get my work done on, and sure I could
            have bought a cheap $300 windows laptop that would run some of the programs I use on a daily basis, but I decided to go with the Macbook Pro because of the
            experience. From Hardware to Software the Macbook Pro is a complete package, and it is very difficult to find another machine in the world with an on par build quality
            and software experience. In my mind the Surface Book would be the next closest machine available.
          </p>
          <p>
            This purchase could prove to be the most important one I will make for my life, not only do I rely upon computers to do work, but I also rely upon them
            for social life and almost everything else I do. This machine will be what I use every single day, its pretty hard to say that about any other product in my
            life than my phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway now I just have to paitently wait until December 14th.
