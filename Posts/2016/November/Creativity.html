            For the past week I have been trying to get my creativity juices flowing by working on different small little projects, things I can get done in
            the span of about an hour or two. Most of these ideas were just small random UI/UX thoughts I wanted to work on, one of them was working on
            styling of a link with a nice animated background color change on hover, another one was to experiment with SVG and styling SVG with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a small part of my mind thats screaming at me for not working on something significant, but at the moment I feel dried out of drive or
            momentum to work on any significant projects. I have this list of things I want to work on but it feels like I just keep on piling on more requirements
            as time goes on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now it feels like work is sucking all the energy and creativity out of me because I am forced to build things with none of the new technologies, or
            because I am also in clean up mode, cleaning up old files across our code base and making sure things still work correctly and look correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am looking forward to my vacation time in two months so I can jump into an exciting new project, something a bit more meaty than just little demos.
          </p>
