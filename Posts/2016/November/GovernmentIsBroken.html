              Alright I'll be honest, that tile is a bit of a clickbaity title. But I do have an interesting point to make about government, specifically
              ours in the US. Its something I noticed with the two tweets embedded below.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Average age of current House Leadership:<br><br>Democrats: 72<br><br>Republicans: 49</p>&mdash; Garrett Ventry (@GarrettVentry) <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettVentry/status/799814956745166849">November 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">During the next Congress, the US is going to be controlled entirely by senior citizens (including Trump).<a href="https://t.co/Id7jeZZxm7">https://t.co/Id7jeZZxm7</a></p>&mdash; dustin curtis (@dcurtis) <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/800483388608028672">November 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

              These tweets tell an interesting story, the group of people that matter the most in the long term of our contry literally have no say in how our country
              operates. I'm not just talking about millennials, but individuals that are younger than 35 have no say in how this government governs.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a ton of bad things that the older generations are forcing upon the younger generations (mostly think about climate change here, but there are others)
              and it doesn't help that the people who have the ability to make changes and make our country truly better are the ones who have no say.
