              Last night I fell asleep at 9:30 pm roughly. I slept alright, thinking all would be alright in the world.
              I woke up at 4:30 am at my first alarm, and blearily got out of bed, and stumbled to my phone. I said "Ok Google, presidential election results",
              and crossed my fingers. Then I heard the exact opposite of what I wanted to hear.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Donald Trump won the presidency. Right now, Donald Trump has 276 electoral votes, while Hillary Clinton has 218.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I stumbled back to my bed and wrapped my blanket around me, and just stared out the window.

              My mind was blank.
            </p>
            <p>
              I picked up my phone and started to scroll through Twitter, saw a ton of sad people, a ton of news posts talking about why this happened,
              and how this happened. I'm not sure many people properly understand how this happened. I may not even have a solid grip on the situation but I do have a pretty strong theory as to why a lot of people are sad and a lot of people are happy. It starts with social media.
            </p>

              Social Media dominated this election, as it has in the previous elections but this one it was more powerful, Facebook is home to more than half of the internet using population across the globe. Think about that, one sixth of the worlds population is on a single connected network. And Twitter has more than 300 Million as well. The problem is that these networks are being used to bring out <em>different</em> voices to be heard, they are only acting as an echo chamber in which you say what you want to say and others say what you want to hear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people praised social networks like Facebook because they believed it would help expose people to new ideas and new people. Yet its proven to do the exact opposite. My network on Facebook is only made up of people who share the same beliefs as I do. Its not really a fault of the platforms or the network, they are actually working exactly as they should, its more a fault of us as humans.

              Social networks are echo chambers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We as humans are flawed to shy away from different ways of thinking about issues, we prefer to stay in our ways because we don't like change. Sometimes we hop on bandwagons because our friends do it also, but for the most part this change is simply a facade of our true thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Donald Trump won because internally a lot of Americans don't want to change. They want to keep living their life without any major changes and die peacefully. I titled this post The American Fall of 2016 because it reminded me a lot of the opposite of the Arab Spring. Social networks empowered millions of people to promote the idea of change, it may not be the change that a lot of people wanted (myself included), nor maybe what the country needed, but it is change.

              Slate had a great article that was pretty hard to swallow after reading this morning, explaining that both political parties are dead after this election, Trump canabalized the Republican Party, as did Clinton (along with Bernie Sanders). Many politicans will go on with the two party system, and I don't expect a third party to gain any significant progress but I think many Americans believe that both parties have significantly changed from what their core beliefs used to be.

                I end with a small sidenote, being a white male gives me a lot of freedom to do and say as I please with little to no repercussions. I truly realize that, and it gives me no ground to stand on when it comes to saying that things will not be as bad as many think they will be. When Trump makes changes, I won't be one of the primary groups of people affected by it. That kills me inside to think and talk about because I believe all people are created equal, but I feel powerless to make a change to this shared wrong standard.
