              True Consumer VR (not gaming VR such as the Vive and Rift) has been really hard to come by for a lot of people. Google started it all off
              with the first commonplace consumer VR headset made literally from cardboard. In the years since the first Cardboard release there have
              been several companies that have built their own cardboard compatible headsets, dropping the old material for pleasent plastics and other
              better materials. The problem was there were really only two platforms for consumer VR out on the market, the first was Cardboard, the second
              (and with much less market penetration) is the Gear VR.
            </p>
            <p>
              However Google has turned that market upside down yet again, only 2 years after developing the market from the ground up they have released the
              Daydream platform and the Daydream View, a comfortable and simple headset made from fabric, foam and a little bit of plastic.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The Daydream View is one of the best VR headsets I have used.</p>
            <p>
              This platform and VR viewer is simply one of the best I have experienced. The software and hardware experience is very much similar to the experience
              of the Pixel phone. Google obviously built the hardware and the software together to get such a great complete experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are however a few small issues with the experience. Honestly some of these are most likely present across all VR headsets but they are still
              something that needs to be addressed in some way in order for VR to get mass adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first is the color shifting at the peripheral areas of the view cone. What I mean by this is that if you look towards an edge of the screen the RGB
              colors will start to shift away and you will clearly see bands of red green and blue. This is most likely a hardware defect, either with using a flat screen
              or with using the lenses in the headset so this is a pretty difficult issue to be solved without releasing new hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second issue I have seen is the framerate. If something runs at anything less than 60 FPS (including youtube videos) you will notice it. I think
              experiencing too much content at frames less than 60 will start to make ou sick. For the most part this is solvable all from the software side of things
              (as long as the hardware is good enough). The only issue here is that there is a lot of content that is still created or recorded at 30 FPS or less.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way I think Daydream is one of the best improvements in consumer VR ever. It is the most comfortable experience available for people who just want
              to easily experience VR.

              Below are a few photos I took of the headset and controller.
