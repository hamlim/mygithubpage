              As I wrote about <a href="/MacbookPro">here</a> I recently bought a new Macbook Pro. This computer has been getting a lot of flak recently
              because of what people like to call donglegate I guess. It turns out that if you are stuck using old hardware (USB-A, SD cards, ethernet, etc.)
              you aren't going to have a good time using the new Macbook Pro computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of people (for now mostly tech reviewers) are complaining about the need for all these dongles, so much so that Apple actually dropped
              the price of many of the adaptors that they sell. However many reviews (like the video below) are set up to complain about the "need" for
              these adaptors.

              These computers are far too expesive to be offered as the baseline computer that you should use every day if you are still using old technology like
              SD cards and ethernet cables. Yes, the Pro line up of Macbooks used to be made for those who were locked into a ton of other pieces of hardware (think
              cameras, displays, external hard drives etc.), however these new machines are different.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new Macbook Pro computers are for early adopters, very much like Google Glass, Snapchat Spectacles, and even the first Surface and Surface Book.
              These computers are made for those who are living in the future of computing. Those who want to see what the future looks like, people who have moved
              to USB-c everywhere, and wireless connectivity, as well as using cloud storage for things like Photos, and documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              I may have lucked out given that I have a USB-c phone, so for me the Macbook Pro +plus the Google Pixel (and wireless headphones to boot
              ) is going to make the perfect mobile experience for me. I understand that many people feel like these computers aren't living up the Pro name but they are
              not made to be the replacement you are looking for.

                I keep thinking of the quote from Henry Ford (which may not have even been said by him at all):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The new Macbook Pro is what we need, its not a faster variant of the older computer, its a new kind of computer, one made for the future of computing and
                connectivity.
