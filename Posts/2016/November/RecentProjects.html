            I have been working on a few different small little ideas recently mostly over on <a href="codepen.io/matthamlin/">Codepen</a> that
            I wanted to talk a bit more about those little ideas here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the ideas I was working on were small litle ideas that kind of stuck in my mind. The perfect example of this is the one I did
            most recently. The idea was to have a simple little toggle on a webpage to invert the colors of the page to make it easier to read.
            You can see this in the embedded pen below, I am using a few lines of JS to add an event listener to the light bulb button at the bottom
            right corner of the page. This event handler simply sets an active flag to check on what colors to set.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              I guess I could have used the color-mod function to get a color that is contrasting with the current color. (More below)
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Then I also set two custom properties on the document element (<code>:root</code>) one for setting the background color and the other for setting
            the color. Thats basically it.
          </p>
          <p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="gLPBjo" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="matthamlin" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Toggle light and dark theme on blog post" data-preview="true" class="codepen"></p>
          <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <pre data-lang="JS"><code>
document.getElementsByClassName('js-btn')[0].addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.getAttribute('active') === 'true') {
    e.target.setAttribute('active', 'false');
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--bg-color', '#fff');
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--color', '#111');
  } else {
    e.target.setAttribute('active', 'true');
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--bg-color', '#111');
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--color', '#fff');
  }
});
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            As I noted in the above aside, I think I could simplify this code quite a bit more, but I will be leaving it in the current form so it is a bit
            easier for others to come to and understand how it is working.
          </p>

            Another little project I worked on was a simple SVG drawing API built out because I wanted a simple JS API to draw to an SVG element like we have
            for Canvas and WebGL. Its still really early on in this development, and I don't really see any good use cases for this, but I just made it to learn a bit more
            about how ES6 classes work.
