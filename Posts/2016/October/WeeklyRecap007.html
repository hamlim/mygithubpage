                  This past week was quite interesting, I had several new
                  project ideas and decided I wanted to clean up a bit in terms
                  of what projects I am actively developing and what project
                  ideas that I want to actively develop. This past week I started
                  to put some work into my new project Metal, which is really interesting
                  because it is bringing me back to my classes on Computer Science in
                  college. I think it will be an interesting project both in terms
                  of the learning aspect and in the building aspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This past week I also posted two new blog posts, both were very dry
                  but they serverd their purpose in allowing me to learn the differences and also the use cases
                  of all the pseudo classes and elements in CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know that it is not an ideal kind of blog post on my site, so I plan on
                  reducing the amount of these kind of blog posts on my site and maybe moving
                  them to another blog that I can just move all the technical blog posts to.
                  This was a concept that I heard on the <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" class="link--article">Shop Talk Show</a>
                  where they talked about seperating blogging concerns between your own domain (matthamlin.me) and
                  another domain that you also own but is set up for blogging about content that isn't personal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I might end up doing exactly that and seperate the content from here to another website
                  however I am still not sure if I want to do that because it already feels like I don't write
                  enough as it is just on this domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So this weekend I will be working on cleaning up the projects I am working on and posting a full list of
                  their state on this blog, as well as cleaning up my blog a bit and maybe moving it to React as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have any thoughts about handling many projects at the same time and also blogging about personal
                  content vs technical content feel free to use the links below to reach out to me! <span css-emoji="point-down"></span>
