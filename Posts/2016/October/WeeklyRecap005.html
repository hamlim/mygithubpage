                    This past week and weekend felt like it went by so quickly, almost every week feels like it goes by too quickly. It is already October and I have been at my job for three months now, time has really gone by quickly. Luckily my cold is starting to slowly fade away which is good, however its still kicking and screaming in my body. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't done that much this past week, similar with the previous week, I did however post two new blog posts, the <a href="/Posts/2016/September/SeptemberUpdate" class="link--article">first</a> was a September Recap, and the <a href="./October4th" class="link--article">second</a> is my cumulative October 4th Google Event article. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This next week I will spening most of my time anxiously waiting for my new phone to arrive and then I plan on writing a complete review of the phone, and if I get the VR viewer I will write a review of that as well.

                    I was able to set up a React version of this site, on the same domain just at /React. I haven't done that much with React yet mostly jsut setting up my build system with Webpack and Babel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also adjusted the font scaling of my website, I now use <code css-code class="inline-block">font-size: calc(1vmin + 1rem);</code> as my default font-size for all pages.
