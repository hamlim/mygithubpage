                Below is a comprehensive (as much as possible) overview of all my current and past and fucture projects that
                I have either started and worked on or am looking at to build. I mostly want to do this to clear my head of all
                the things I am trying to work on.
              </p>
              <h4>Past:</h4>
              <p>
                This first group of projects are the really old ones that I no longer work on at all and basically have abandoned.
              </p>
              <ul css-ul>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">PTWN: Trends aka CurrentWire aka Project Taiwan</h5>
                  <ins>Don't ask me why I chose that project codename, I have no idea</ins>
                  <p>
                    Thiins was my first major web project, it involved using the Twitter API to build a simple news curation service that anyone could go to
                    in order to see the top 10 tweets by the accounts I had selected by hand.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">RPIDelivery:</h5>
                  <p>
                    This was a project that I never fully launched, it was meant to be a simple DoorDash like solution for food delivery to
                   college students. The reason this never actually went anywhere was because I was simply too lazy to actually work out how to handle payments.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">RPILMS-Redesign:</h5>
                  <p>
                    This was an early attempt at flexing some design thinking to redesign the current learning management system used by RPI.
                    I never made this actually useful it simply acted like a living working prototype.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">CampusLife</h5>
                  <p>
                    This was an interesting idea I had about building a network of news sites for college campuses to grow the amount of knowledgeable students
                    and also grow the interest in student authors.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Email Templates</h5>
                  <p>
                    This was a weekend project where I wanted to automate the generation of the emails I sent to employeers looking for jobs. What is really
                    cool about this project is that I was able to spin up a working web app around this idea. Check it out <a href="http://goexploring.today/Email-Templates/" data-css-link-article>here</a>.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Current:</h4>
              <p>
                These projects are things that I have recently worked on or have been working on within the past 6 months.
              </p>
              <ul css-ul>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Dollar</h5>
                  <p>
                    Dollar is one of my most ambitous but also one of a few "completed" projects that I have worked on. I still plan on reworking the entire application
                    using React and other React frameworks like Router and also Redux.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Bundles</h5>
                  <p>
                    This is another one of project that I got to a state where I felt like it worked well enough to stop working on it actively. I might come back to
                    the idea and rebuild it with React or maybe even Vue.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">HN-Redesign</h5>
                  <p>
                    This project was another one off design website project similar to RPILMSRedesign above, where I simply wanted to flex some of my design thinking
                    as well as work on some CSS stuff as well.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Colors</h5>
                  <p>
                    Colors was a simple React ES6 web app I made one afternoon to work a bit in React and also test out Now a service that allows me to spin up a simple
                    website just from the command line. You can check it out <a href="http://goexploring.today/colors/" data-css-link-article>here</a> but it isn't
                    100% always working (also will basically not work on any non-evergreen browser).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Boilerplate</h5>
                  <p>
                    Boilerplate was a simple project that I made to quickly use as a base for all future projects, it is using React, Webpack and a few other things.
                    I recently updated it to future-boilerplate that swapped out SCSS loaders to PostCSS loaders.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Future:</h4>
              <p>These are the projects that I want to work on and have been sitting on for a very long time.</p>
              <ul>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Food Tracker:</h5>
                  <p>
                    As someone who wants to have a better understanding of my eating habits I want to track the kind of food I eat from day to day and month to month.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Water Tracker:</h5>
                  <p>
                    This is basically the same thing as above but I want to track how much water I drink day to day and try to make realistic goals on how much water
                    I should be drinking everyday.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Task Manager:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Just like every developer I want to build my own todo app with my concept of how to manage the state of tasks.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">A better Dollar:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Ever since I made Dollar I wish I had done it in a better way and a more extensible way. I relied on several hacks to build it and to make
                    it work like it does.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li css-li>
                  <h5 class="escape--default">Metal:</h5>
                  <p>
                    The goal of Metal is to learn more about the structure of the DOM and also to learn more about ES6 classes as well.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                So that is a quick breakdown of all my past, current and future projects I want to work on. As time goes on I will try to update this
                blog post with information about each project and add on the more projects as I have more ideas.
              </p>
