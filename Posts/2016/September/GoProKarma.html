                    The other day GoPro launched the <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/karma" class="link link--article">Karma</a>, its first foray into the drone market. In case you only recently found my blog, or just this post, I wrote about this happening in January of this year. You can find that post <a href="/Posts/2016/January/DJIvsGoPro" class="link link--article">here</a>, this blog post will be a bit about how the Karma will change things. Fair warning, I have yet to fly either the Karma or any other drone from DJI or otherwise, the following will be entirely my opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Karma is revolutionary not because of its parts or components, but because of what it can do compared to the industry leader DJI. GoPro focused on building a great user friendly drone with the Karma, and when compared to the DJI it feels like the Karma will be the preferred drone for the group of consumers between the general public and drone hobbyists. You see that in the price, the portability, and also in the camera gear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of price, the Karma is half the price of the DJI Phantom 4, that immediately makes it stand out to a more layman adventuring individual instead of the hobbyists that would be wanting to go for the Phantom 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of portability I think Casey Neistat said it perfectly:
                </p>
                <iframe class="video" css-youtube src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cf16mp6Nbh8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    Camera gear, this is where GoPro literally excells. This is what they do as a company, they have individually revolutionized the market for action cameras and have become the industry standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was really obvious to me that GoPro was going to enter into the Drone market sometime soon because most of the market is focused on using Drones to advance photography and videography. I can't wait to see what other uses Drones start to solve and what companies will enter the market because of these other solutions. Maybe this time next year I will be writing about Netflix entering the Drone business for delivery.

                    As always, feel free to tweet me your comments and thoughts about this move by GoPro, I am always willing to talk more about Drones and their uses. <a href="https://twitter.com/immatthamlin" class="link link--article">@immatthamlin</a>
