                    This past week went by fairly quickly, mostly because at work we are ramping up for launch of an exciting new project I am working on and also because I feel like all my time has either been at work or in transit or sleeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am really excited to say that I have been tackling some really interesting tasks on this new project at work including optimizing out landing page load times and also working with css animations. A lot of my time has been spent on the mobile web side of the site which I love because it allows me to actually use the CSS I want to, with things like Flexbox and other advanced css things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work I have been working on a lot of css things and also doing quite a bit of writing. In the past week alone I wrote 3 blog posts, with this one being the 4th. I wrote <a href="./GoogleEventUpdates" data-css-link-article>about updates to my Google Predictions blog post</a>, I talked about <a href="./GoProKarma" data-css-link-article>the GoPro Karma drone</a>, and also wrote about a <a href="./VideoAspectRatioWithCSS" data-css-link-article>perserving aspect ratios with CSS calc()</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my development outside of work has been spent on building out this site here and there. I have been wanting to try and start converting parts of this site to React, but I still feel like I should do that in another repo just so I have the plain old html and css website to fall back on. This week I added full bleed videos to blog posts, improved the fonts of the website and also tinkered with the line-height a bit as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the things I still have on my list to try and tackle soon, I know some of these have been carried over from the last time I posted them, but I still have yet to get into them. The main blocker for me on several of these projects is lacking a good setup with React, Router and Redux with Webpack, css modules and postcss support, so if you know of such a resource please let me know!

                <ul data-css-ul>
                    <li data-css-li>Task Manager:
                        <small>This has been boiling over in my mind for so long, I have been looking for a simple todo app that will let me customize it completely, and unfortunately no app has offered this yet.</small>
                    </li>
                    <li data-css-li>React components on this website</li>
                    <li data-css-li>Water consumption tracker:
                        <small>This should be really easy, but I just need a simple API-based DB for storing the data that I can get to via fetch.</small>
                    </li>
                    <li data-css-li>Food tracker</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Small sidenote, I have been looking into adding extra features to this blog, things like read counts, comments, suggested articles and more but right now because 100% of each blog post is written by hand I can't easily update all my blog posts to include these.
