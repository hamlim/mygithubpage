                    This past week felt really slow, yet somehow finished off quickly. After a small scare at work right before I was leaving with some critical bugs, it should end really great because I found a great new burrito place right across from my apartment. I got what Anna's Taqueria called a Super Super Burrito, and it was indeed really super.

                    In terms of projects this week has been pretty terrible, I haven't made any progress on any project of significance at all. I have begun to think about implementing this blog in React. I know currently it is really quick to load up because there is no JS at all on my site. However I feel like I need the experience with React and react Router.

                    This weekend I hope to spend more time outside, maybe even heading into Boston to explore a bit more. Yet I also want to spend a good amount of time actually building a side project as well. I guess you will have to wait for my Weekend Projects post on Sunday to see what I ended up doing 😉!
