                    Google is planning to drop a few new pieces of hardware on <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/01/google-will-announce-pixel-phones-4k-chromecast-google-home-daydream-vr-viewer-on-october-4th/" class="link link--out">October 4th</a> and there have been many rumors about what hardware will be announced. A lot of rumors are pointing to a rename of the Nexus branded phones to Pixel phones, a release of the Daydream VR headset, a 4k chromecast device, and maybe even a re-launch of the fan beloved Nexus 7 tablet<sup><a href="fn1" class="link" data-footnote="We are still not sure if this 7 inch tablet will bare the Nexus brand name or the Pixel brand name.">1</a></sup>. I figured I would try my hand at rounding up all the rumors so far and also put forward some guesses at what we can expect Google to present at that event.
                </p>
                <section class="hardware">
                    <h3>Hardware:</h3>
                    <p>
                        In terms of hardware most people are sure that Google will announce 5 devices with the potential for a sixth device. The first two are two new phones originally codenamed Marlin and Sailfish but now potentially being named Pixel XL and Pixel<sup><a href="#fn2" class="link" data-footnote="The Pixel XL device should be the one with a screen size of about 5.5 inches to potentially 5.7 inches, and the Pixel is going to have a screensize between 5 and 5.5 inches.">2</a></sup>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third piece of hardware is going to be the Google Home device, they announced this at Google I/O this year. This device is basically going to offer Google Assistant (see the Software section) through an Amazon Echo like device for your home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth piece of hardware is potentially going to be a VR headset called Daydream VR. We saw some rough sketches of a design at Google I/O of this hardware but I am not 100% that we will actually see something too dramatic. I have a few notes about this in my Predictions section below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fifth piece of hardware is potentially a new Chromecast device, this time supporting 4k video. If this does get announced I will actually be pretty excited, especially if they launch it at the same price point that the current Chromecast devices are being sold at. There are also some rumors about a new Chromecast Audio device but I haven't seen too many rumors about this, nor do I see any reason for a new audio version to be announced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last piece of hardware that we might see at the event is a Huawei-built Nexus 7 successor. Many people have been asking for a smaller tablet to be announced, and by the looks of things I am not too sure if this will get announced at this event simply because of the lack of leaks. I personally really hope they come out with a successor to my beloved 2013 Nexus 7. If they do announce it I expect them to label it as potentially the Pixel B, so it can act as a little brother to the Pixel C Chrome os tablet.

                <section class="software">
                    <h3>Software:</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the software side of things, a lot of people are pointing to a new update of Android Nougat, supposedly version 7.1. We already know that Google is getting ready to release the new version because several Google Apps have been targeting API Level 25 and stock 7.0 is only at API Level 24 currently. Along with a new version of Android we might also see a splintering between the Google version of Android like that on current Nexus phones and to be released Pixel phones and maybe tablets, and the stock version of Android
                        that third party OEM's will use to put on their devices (I will talk more about this in my Predictions section below). Along with the new version of Android Google is expected to release Google Assistant, the AI-like software that will be taking over for Google Now and Google Voice Search, as well as Allo the Android answer to iMessage. I also expect some time to be spent talking about their VR software and User Experience with it as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the hype on the software side of things is placed in Allo, many Android fans have been waiting for a concrete answer to a universal messaging application from Google, and many worries are that Google will not add in SMS support at launch, which could cripple the application more than one might think. If Allo launches without SMS support, as many rumors and beta testers are pointing to, Google will essentially be launching a new version of Google Hangouts but with a cleaner design.

                    <h3>Predictions:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now to get into the good part of this blog post, the predictions! I am going to go a bit on the light side in terms of predictions here.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Prediction: Google Allo will launch <em>without</em> SMS support.</h4>
                    <p>
                        I really hope I am wrong here but everything is pointing to no SMS support on Allo. I haven't seen too many posts about/from Allo Beta testers, but the last I heard was that there was no SMS.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Prediction: Android will split into two separate versions. Google's Android and Open Source Android</h4>
                    <p>
                        This has been happening for a while now, first with the launcher and now within 7.0 where the settings are Google specific. We also saw this in a leak earlier before 7.0 came out that Google will launch a special app integrated within Nougat for device support.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Prediction: There will be no Nexus 7 released this year.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Again I realy hope I am wrong here, however I feel like with the lack in the number of leaks either Google has this completely under wraps or the device doesn't exist. We heard rumors about this a few years back also and nothing came from that too.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <p>
                    Ultimately I am still really pumped for this event. It might end up being even larger than I/O in terms of big announcements, I also really hope that the event gets more press/is in a bigger location than last year's Nexus event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you know I made a mistake with the above information please reach out to me so I can fix the article, or if you have any other predictions I would love to hear them as well!
