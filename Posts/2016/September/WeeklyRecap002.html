                    This past week was a bit shorter in terms of working days because of Labor day. I was really productive last weekend and during work but I wasnt so productive outside of work.

                    I have been trying to drink a lot more water recently, and this past week I think I have averaged about 3 (32oz water bottles) per day. I might end up making a really simple water tracking application so I can keep a better eye on it.

                    I feel like I have been drowning in projects to work on, and I am at the point where I need to make a backlog that I can always go back to and work on. If you have any advice on keeping up with a lot of projects please reach out to me via <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmatthamlin.me%2FPosts%2FPub%2F2016%2FSeptember%2FWeeklyRecap002&via=immatthamlin&text=%20%20-&" class="link link--out">tweet</a>, <a href="mailto:matthewjameshamlin@gmail.com" class="link link--out">email</a> or <a data-footnote="+1 425 210 0980" href="sms:+14252100980" class="link link--out">text</a>.

                    This next week is going to be really long at work, the team I am working on has been working on making a new project feature complete and get it ready for launch. Hopefully I find time to also work on my side projects. I have been getting up at around 4:30am and working from 7 sometimes 6:45 until 4, its really taking a good chunk out of my energy and time.

                    Those are the only major updates for this weekly recap, make sure to stay tuned to my website (I still really need to get a working RSS feed) or follow me on twitter where I tweet every new blog post.
