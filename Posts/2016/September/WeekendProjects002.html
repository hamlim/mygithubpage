                    This weekend I didn't really work on too many projects. I was sick Friday evening and most of Saturday also with a really bad headache/migraine. But most of Saturday and Sunday I spent learning about building applications with React in ES2015. Sunday morning I recorded a video code along, the first of maybe a few such videos. You can find the video on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJvfPNCnRnc" class="link link--article">here</a><sup><a href="#fn1" class="link" data-footnote="Note! The audio is really bad and I made several mistakes recording it, but at least I can learn about that in the future. If you have any feedback about how to improve my recordings reach out to me, I would love to learn more!">1</a></sup>.

                <p>
                    Most of the rest of the weekend was spent looking into Vue.js which I have tried learning before also but I think I want to build a small application with it as a simple point of reference about the basics of the framework.

                    Also for future reference here are the projects I want to work on in the soon:

                    <li class="li--spacing">Expense Manager</li>

                    <li class="li--spacing">Meal manager/tracker/diary</li>
