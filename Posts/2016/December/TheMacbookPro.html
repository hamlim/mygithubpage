          I really want to love this machine, but every day I find new and odd flaws with it. This post will serve as a 
          collection of these flaws that I have noticed in the past two weeks and I will (maybe) update it as time goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really hope most of these can be solved by software updates but I seriously think some of these flaws are 
          hardware specific.

          <h3 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h3>
          <p>
            This is what a lot of people have been talking about online and elsewhere. The battery life on these new 
            computers is abysmal. Many people are unable to get more than 3 hours out of the computer. Now I understand 
            that the battery life that Apple was advertising at (10 hours) was under optimal conditions simply playing back videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tested it this afternoon and repeatedly went from <var>100%</var> to <var>~10%</var> after about 2 hours and 
            50 minutes. This was when I was running Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Hyperterminal, a several other small 
            electron apps. I have since switched over to using Safari Tech Preview, Visual Studio Code and also killed off a 
            few of the other electron apps and I am now getting about 4 hours. This is still way too low.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am sure there are far more optimizations I can take to milk an extra hour or maybe an hour and a half out 
            of the machine but this is still pretty disapointing. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 64 64" class="svg-reset">

          <h3 id="poor-touchbar-support-in-apple-apps">Poor Touchbar Support in Apple Apps</h3>
          <p>
            This one really took me by surprise, there are still many websites within Safari that handle media and other 
            activities like text input the exact same as sites that support things like media controls and text options 
            like emoji and predictive texts but for some reason Safari doesn't recognize them. The best example of this 
            is when playing music from Google Play Music in Chrome, the media controls work fine, I can pause and skip 
            tracks freely from the touchbar, yet when playing the same music in Google Play Music in Safari the media 
            controls no longer work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am sure much of this issue is that app developers haven't added the new API's to their applications, I 
            just hope that Apple can begin to push these to more and more developers so the experience for us Macbook Pro users is better.

          <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
          <p>
            The performance on the computer has been really hit or miss recently. Sometimes when swiping up to
             open expose the screen will stutter and will lag for the animation. This computer is nearly fully spec'd out and yet the 
             animations on the OS level are still not 100% on. If it weren't for the exterior design I think some people would think this is a cheap Chinese rip off of macOS.
          </p>

          I fully expect this list to change in the coming months as new updates come out and other tips and tricks get found out by others 
          using the computer as well, however this feels like they rushed it out to market even though it took 4 years for them to redesign the 
          Macbook Pro. Honestly I would have waited until January for one with a Kaby lake processor and all these bugs ironed out. Also I 
          love the thinness but I think they could have sacrificed some trackpad size as well as making it a bit thicker to stick a bigger battery into this computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really love the feel of the computer, and won't fully regret getting it for the life of the device, but I will still have 
          to live with some of these issues.
