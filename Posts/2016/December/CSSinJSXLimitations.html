            I really enjoy writing my html in javascript these days. If you told me that I felt this way about jsx a year ago I would have laughed in your face, 
            heck I even tweeted about why I hated jsx. But now I feel like I understand why React developers decided on this kind of programming. The UI is a 
            function of your current state, this state can be either stored or passed down through props, but it is bound to this state. Writing your html in a 
            different place than where you handle the state of the view seems pretty crazy once this idea clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            However I have one large issue that is holding me back from fully accepting jsx, and that is css. Unlike many other UI developers also using React 
            or other vdom view frameworks I still really love writing css. Especially bleeding edge css that I use <code>postcss-cssnext</code> to compile out
             to current day css. Now I have publicly stated a few times (or have meant to) that i only intend on building web apps that only support evergreen 
             browsers, however there are still a ton of css features that I am using with cssnext that I can't use in most browsers. Even the super advanced 
             browsers like Chrome Canary or Safari Tech Preview.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that I can't use some of these cool css features has held me back from jumping fully into the jsx lifestyle. I have been playing around 
            with some css in js libraries. (I really enjoy <code>cxs</code> by Brent Jackson <a href="https://github.com/jxnblk/cxs">Link here</a> ) but even 
            that library has some limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure some of the functionality that I am using in CSS could be accomplished with some javascript and a few custom properties in CSS, but I haven't 
            had the time to work on breaking down the css syntax with JS, parsing it and then building out something that spits out the values I need. (Weekend

            I really wish that I could write css as I know it, and have it parsed by postcss during my build step, my ideal solution I guess would then be to
             use template literals that inject the styles into a style tag, or get rolled up into a stylesheet for cacheing purposes, and that get scoped to 
             the component either by a shared root selector or by some other method, something like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>const styles = `
.component.component {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
.component .component-child {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100vw;
}`;
</code></pre>
          <p>
            I do however feel that until I set up some sort of server side rendering for my websites that I won't be able to even use a method like above 
            because generally these methods insert a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag into the html instead of generating a css file that I can load in like 
            I do currently. All in all I not missing out on any sort of great advancement, with the lack of full features and support as well as the granularity 
            of control over how the css gets generated my current process will work for me for the coming months.
