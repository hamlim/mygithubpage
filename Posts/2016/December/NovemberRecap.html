              A quick forward, I am not even sure when this post will go up, I have started writing it on the 4th of December, but currently I have no working 
              internet so you may only see this in a few weeks. So most of this will probably get worked out by then but then again maybe not.

            This past month of November was really slow for me. I stopped all my recurring posts such as Weekend Projects, Weekly Updates and also 
            the Sunday Morning Recaps. I might start these back up in the near future but I need to get my schedule properly worked out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I only published about 18 posts, most of them were pretty bland and didn't really contain any great content. As I said above I really need to 
            get a better schedule, or rather <u>any</u> schedule in the works to focus on not only more writing, but better quality writing, as well as more 
            time working on projects. 
          </p>
          <p>
            November also marked a new article and website redesign that I am not 100% sold on yet, so I may tweak it in the comming days to weeks.

            The last month marks the 12 month anniversary since I started blogging in earnest. Although I skipped a lot of months between January and August of this 
            year, I have been blogging for at least a year now. I hope that I can continue my past three to four month momentum into the next year.
