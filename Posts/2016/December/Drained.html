            Over the past three to four weeks I have been struggling to do almost anything except my daily routine. I wake up at 5am in the 
            morning, take a shower, brush teeth, cook breakfast either a fried egg or two or some oatmeal, make some coffee. Then I get ready
             for work, take the train into work at 6:15am, work until 4, take the train back to my place and then somehow waste the time 
             between 4:30 and roughly 9pm then sleep and repeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to fill that time between 4:30 and 9 by working on my side projects or writing for this blog. But now days I have been playing video games and browsing the web.

            I feel physically and mentally drained.

            I haven't had any good ideas recently about either blog posts or new projects I can work on. I was really hoping that once I got 
            my new computer I would be firing on all cylinders in terms of making things. Unfortunately this year has left me feeling really burned out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never truly understood the meaning of burnout, it was always a topic that I read about and figured that it wouldn't hit me because 
            I was young and not working that much. But putting in 9 and a half hours every weekday for the past 6 months has quite literally 
            drained me of all creativity and energy I have for making things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I only have three general ideas that I want to pursue as soon as possibly to try and get out of this burnout rut that 
            I am in. I want to 1) Get out more, both with people and also just away from my computer and other distractions, 2) Exercise, 
            I believe that a healthy body will help build a healthy mind and finally 3) Challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            These three things make up my resolutions for 2017. I have written a lot about resolutions in the past on this blog and on other 
            blogs as well, and I am for the most part not a huge fan of putting goal setting off until the next year. So I don't necessarily 
            plan on waiting until January first to start acting on these goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you know of any other methods to get past burnout please let me know, this is a feeling I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy,
             and I will make sure to write more about this as the new year progresses. I will also add a tag to this post and others to make 
             it easier to jump to related posts. Simply follow the <a href="/tags/burnout">#burnout tag</a> for related posts.
