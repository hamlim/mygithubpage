            I haven't shipped a working personal project in almost a full year. I have shipped several updates to my personal site, but nothing meaningful as 
            a user-centric web app. This hurts to admit especially in an environment like today's around developers, where all that matters is momentum. As 
            long as you are shipping something, all is well in the world.
          </p>

            I intend on fixing this drought during this week and a half I have off from work. I will be milking the most amount of time I can on the flights as
             well as the off time when I am not enjoying the company of my family.
            </p>
          <p>
            One of the issues that has paralyzed me in the time since I last shipped something was because I started working with frameworks and libraries 
            that require a compile stage. Prior to now I was simply writing plain old JS and committing it and pushing to remote and that was it, now I need 
            to write my JS, transpile/compile it and then push to remote. Getting that build system setup to work with the project I am working on is kind 
            of a difficult task. Plus whenever I start a new project I have to go to the last project, copy over the dependencies from the last one, re-install
             them, then copy over my Webpack config file and hope I have a similar setup as the last project in terms of file organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have written <strong>72</strong> blog posts this year so far, not counting this one which has also distracted me from doing development work. One of 
            the first blog posts I wrote was about splitting time between blogging and building, and I now realize fully how much of a precarious balance is needed 
            in order to do both relatively frequently. ðŸ˜°
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway I felt like I needed to get this off of my shoulders, and also explain why I might not be blogging that much come January.
