            So I woke up a whole hour late this morning, I am actually surprised I made it into work only about 15 minutes later than
            when I normally get in (maybe that says something about how much extra time I can sleep in normally).

            So that thing I said a few blog posts ago about more work coming has turned out to be false. I am so bored at work now days I wish I was
            taking on larger and larger projects that I could actually solve properly.
          </p>

            So I have basically given up on the food logging, its just too much of a hastle to keep updating the log during work hours. Its also difficult
            to track the amount of food I am eating. I have actually been thinking about coming back to a soylent like diet. Its just so expensive though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also really need to get this blog build phase working again, I think I need to rethink the way I store the posts in JSON. I need to break
            the posts array down into year and then month just like I have been doing before. I then need a function to run through the years and each month
            and then each post in there to generate a list of tagged articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seriously considering just throwing this data into something like Airtable or Fieldbook or even Firebase. I jsut want it easier to store the
            posts and them simply query an API to get the posts.
          </p>

            Ok so I figured out the above problem, decided to live with two seperate json stores for the blog posts, one flat for the tags listing
            and the other more jagged for article listing. I still need to figure out how to cut back on all the steps to build a blog page. I have to currently:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Make a new HTML file with my content (direct copy of the previous article)</li>
            <li>Change the data attribute on the blog post</li>
            <li>Add the blog post to the <code>posts.json</code> endpoint store file</li>
            <li>Add the blog post to the <code>tags.json</code> endpoint store file</li>
            <li>Add the post to the monthly index file</li>
            <li>Add the post to the js that builds the headers, footers, and tags section of each blog page</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So if you ask me thats about 6 more steps than I would like.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            An important note: all of this is manual right now. I really need to cut back on these processes that are manual.
