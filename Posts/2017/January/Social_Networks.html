            I recently tweeted a bit about some of my thoughts on social networks/platforms because of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west">this great article </a> 
            about the author leaving twitter for a multitude of reasons but mostly because of the few core issues with Twitter. You can find the really short tweetstorm <a href="https://twitter.com/immatthamlin/status/816404409592717312">here</a>
            but I will be basically covering the same content in this blog post, so feel free to keep reading!
          </p>

          <p>Twitter has a few core issues that I think are really holding it back from becoming an even better platform to use for all users. These core issues are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hate Speech</li>
            <li>Friction to share</li>
            <li>conversations are a mess</li>
            <li>Hard to form tight knit networks of friends and family</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There are of course a few other things I and a lot of others want as well (including editing tweets), however I feel like if these four things get solved the 
            entire platform will benefit over night.
          </p>
          <p> 
            I don't intend on simply listing off all the issues with Twitter, instead I plan on laying down some interesting thoughts I have had about solving these issues 
            both in terms of something that can be implemented within twitter but also might build the basis of a personal project.
          </p>
          <p>
            So lets start with the first problem, this is in my mind the hardest one to solve correctly, most other networks allow others to report 
            users that are doing something wrong. The problem with this is that a lot of people can abuse this reporting system to get accounts banned 
            from networks. This has been discussed a bit in regards to Github's reporting system recently. Twitter has account reporting, and also 
            individual tweet reporting as well, however there never actually seems to be any action taken against the accounts or tweets that I have reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can think of an inital thought as to how to solve this issue, if you require a buy in to use the network something really simple like $1/month
            it prevents people from either creating a ton of fake accounts, it also adds a small barrier for people that might want to create an account only to 
            harrass and bully others on the platform. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course this limits the network to those who can afford to be part of the network (those with access to some sort of disposable income) however a way 
            to overcome this is for an extra dollar a month you are allowed to sponser up to 5 users to use the platform for free. This is designed to provide yet 
            another barrier to prevent people from easily joining the platform for harrasment, as well as built in network effects of building the user base.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this way provides a simple barrier to entry for people who wish to spam the network with harrassment and it also adds the benefit of providing an income 
            for either Twitter or whatever network builds this out.
