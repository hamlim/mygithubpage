            Today I am leaving home to fly back to Boston for work, I am not sure yet as to when I will be returning back to the pacific northwest but I have plans 
            to come back in mid july for a two week camping trip in Bend Oregon (not 100% sure if it will happen though).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime I will have to slowly get back into the flow of going to work everyday, I will of course try to make some changes to meet my new years resolutions
            but I will most likely fall back to my regular old habits.
          </p>

            Its 10:36am, and I am waiting to board the flight, just had some McDonalds and it was pretty terrible, I don't plan on having any more for a long while. Hopefully my seat 
            on the plane has a charging port so I can charge my phone and computer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Not that much else to add here today, I might write more this evening when I get back to my apartment.
