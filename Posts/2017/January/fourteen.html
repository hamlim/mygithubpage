            This morning I slept in quite a bit, I didn't end up getting out of bed until 10:30am. I plasn on having some oatmeal for breakfast
            then doing the dishes and then going grocery shopping to stop and shop a few blocks away.
          </p>
          <p>
            I might as well also head over to Trader Joes to get some soy milk as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well grocery shopping went well this morning, I talked with my dad and also called my grandma.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evening I think I will be cooking up some ground turkey with some taco seasoning, I am not really in the mood for tacos and
            I only really have cheese, tortillas, seasoning, ground turkey and guacamole, but I might as well cook it up.

            I also want to get some work done on refacotoring my website yet again. A lot of other things have fallen by the wayside as I have been
            focusing on this site but right now it feels like shit if I am being honest.
          </p>
          <p>
            It feels kind of odd that its split up into four different pages and many other sub-pages beyond that too. I should start with a map of
            how I want visitors to navigate the site, as well as what content I want to highlight for the visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is starting to feel like I am over-engineering it but I want it to look really nice and also work really well. Lets start with designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be right back, going to work on designs in my notebook.
