            Oh man, I totally forgot to write this morning, so I am writing this as my laundry is in the machine and I am frantically 
            thinking about what I am going to be doing for dinner tonight or tomorrow evening.
          </p>

            Today at work I finally felt like things are starting to get back into the flow of working on a lot of stuff. There are some big developments 
            happening internally at Wayfair that are pretty exciting for engineers and will be pretty exciting for the customers too. Thats about all 
            I can say about it though, sorry! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work and dinner options there seems to be not that much happening with my life, kind of feels silly to say though. I did look 
            into styled-components and I am using it for the Tag badge below, let me know if you see any issues with it!
