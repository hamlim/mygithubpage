            About three months ago I toyed around with an idea of using this blog as a daily 
            journal, and since today is a pretty popular day to start things that won't last long 
            I figured I might as well give this idea a try. So from here on out, all posts tagged with
            <a href="/tags#daily">#daily</a> will be my personal journal entries posted every day until 
            I get tired of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't plan on writing a lot, nor writing a lot of breakthrough content about insightful topics
            this will simply be a plain old journal for me.
