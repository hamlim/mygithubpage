            Well its 1pm and my body thinks its closer to 9pm. I am pretty tired and also feel like I have wasted a lot of time today.
            Maybe it was because I haven't had any coffee this morning, I am tempted to make a cup now, and it probably won't have too much
            effect on my sleep this evening.

            In other news I went to Trader Joes this morning and got some soy milk, chocolate milk and some blended berries.

            Yesterday I did quite a bit amount of work designing the new landing page on my blog, I have a desktop design worked out
            but it looks like shit on mobile so I plan to build out a truly responsive site. I have a feeling building different
            sites for different platforms is frowned upon a lot but It also seems like a good way to split up some of your code
            (potentially making better performance for all users by only loading the code you need).
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking of only loiading the code you need there was a concept that was actually quite interesting that was introduced by one of
            the web developers on the messenger.com, he was talking about the normal autoprefixer solution that most web devs use. However
            messenger takes the next step, they only ship css that can be used on the users browser. So instead of shipping 5+ lines of autoprefixed css
            they only ship the one line that is needed for your browser. This seems like quite a simple idea but it sounds more like a really
            exciting idea. Imaging being able to deliver one fifth the css that you ship when building websites.
          </p>

          <p>
            So instead of hacking more on my blog prototype I decided to brew myself a cup of coffee and get some work done on the Dollar refactor.
            This is an intresting refactor because its basically removing all the code I have there and starting off fresh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wow this is in so much disarray, a ton of manual dom manipulation as well as a lot of jquery. This project has been sitting there just asking
            for a refactor, but I think it might actually be better to just trash it all and start from the ground up.
