            So far the food tracking and money tracking are going well, its only the second day but I feel like I will be able to make a pretty good analysis
            if I keep up with the data collection.

            Last night I didn't go to sleep until around 1, because I got up at 11 to work more on the infrastructure of this blog. Its still really loose around the edges
            but it is getting there. Right now it will only work for really new browsers, so I have some work to do to remove the newer dependencies to make it work with
            a lot more browsers.
          </p>

            Ugh, work feels like a mess right now, it feels like there is nothing to do, but in the same vein it feels like there is so much to do as well.
