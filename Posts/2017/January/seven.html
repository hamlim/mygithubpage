            Here comes the snow. This morning I woke up around 4am, and was in between sleeping and being awake
            until around 10 am, so I might take a quick nap this afternoon, or just brew some coffee.

            I also decided to mix things up a bit on my development side and drop VSCode for Atom again. I miss the
            build in Git stuff, but I love the built in Git and terminal too. Also when I am working on several different
            projects Atom works far quicker than changing different VSCode windows.

            This weekend I plan on working a bit on some of my backlog of tasks to get to with this site as well as a few
            side projects in the works as well.

            Well I ended up getting quite a bit of snow, I will have to go out early tomorrow morning to get some good shots of
            it and might even make another photos post here on my blog.

            I also wasted the entire day by only watching youtube videos and playing video games. I plan on getting some work done this
            evening but I am not sure if I will be able to get anything serious done.
