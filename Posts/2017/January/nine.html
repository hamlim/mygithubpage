            Wow I almost forgot to write this post today, its currently 7pm and I was just about to start working on setting up a project, or working a bit
            on this blog and then realized I hadn't touched a blog post this morning. I shouldn't get in the habit of thinking that I need to push these
            posts out each day, but rather keep this as a simple area to just write.
          </p>

            Today I started tracking the food that I eat, or at least I am trying to start tracking the food that I eat. We will see how long it lasts. I also
            will spin up a spreadsheet to track the money that I spend on my credit card.

            Work has been starting to offer me more and more challenging things to work on, but we have a few refactoring/redesign sprints up-coming that should be
            fun to work on.

            I have recently been listening to a lot of Bryson Tiller's late 2014 album, its pretty good which is kind of surprising. I just kicked on some Kendrick
            Lamar to get some work done, and man have I been missing some of his verses.

            For those who don't know the build process for these blog posts is actually quite messy, I have to touch three files at least, one I have to edit twice in two
            different spots. The worst part is that the JS that defines the header content is getting about 20 lines longer for every blog post. I need to build a proper
            system to convert some sort of file between html and markdown into these blog posts.

            <p> I might as well re-write jekyll while I am at it.</p>

            Ok so I have been listening to <cite>untitled unmastered</cite> by Kendrick Lamar and man is it great, but I personally prefer Kendrick on <cite>good kid, m. A. A. d city</cite>.

            I might as well completely re-think this blog, build it from the ground up based on React, storing files somewhere else that I can pull in via ajax, and handle routing via
            <var>react-router</var>. I started a project called <u>blog-2017</u> on github, I am trying out <var>create-react-app</var> also so its a good learning project.
