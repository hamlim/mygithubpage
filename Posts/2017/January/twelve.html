            I woke up kind of on time today, decided to sleep in a bit anyway. But now it is 6am and I still have to finish my breakfast and
            pack my lunch.

            Well today was actually quite good at work, I started work on a larger project and also fixed a few bugs as well! I wasn't able to write that
            much today but I should be able to write quite a bit tomorrow.
