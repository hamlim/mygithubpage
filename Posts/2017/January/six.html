          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            This morning I woke up kind of groggy, having only slept about 6 hours max last night. But then I had the best shower thought in a while, 
            its Friday!
          </p>

            Work was kind of interesting today, but honestly the best part of it was going  out for lunch with three other co-workers/friends to the best sushi place in town.
            I definitely had way too much to eat but it was good.
          </p>
          <p>
            It snowed a bit this morning but its really supposed to come down tomorrow all day, so I am not sure what I am going to do for groceries, might have to go through the 
            snow or earlier in the morning.
