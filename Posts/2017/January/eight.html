            This morning I woke up fairly early to go outside and see exactly how much snow we got here yesterday and last night.
            It turns out it wasn't that much, only about 4-5 inches here, I am sure there are some places in Mass. that got around a foot maybe.
          </p>

            During this walk I also dropped by Trader Joes to pick up some more things for dinner as well as some more soy milk for my coffee.
            I really need to settle in on a diet of some sort, I plan on starting a basic food tracking excel sheet or something along those lines
            to track how much food I eat each day.
          </p>

            For the rest of the day I plan on working a bit on this website, as well as maybe experimenting with a small idea I have had about
            compiling the react stuff of this website locally so that when I push it to Github, it will act as if it has been compiled on the server.
            This is just a stop gap for finding a service that allows me to run stuff on the server, it might mean I have to pay for some sort of
            hosting.
