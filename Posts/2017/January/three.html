          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            Today is the first day back at work after my week long vacation, I am kind of looking forward to it but at the same time I am 
            simply looking forward to 4pm when I can head back to my place.

            Well I feel like I am getting just a bit more sick, I felt like I had a slight fever at work all day, and I am feeling a bit out of sorts too. I guess it 
            could be just a rush of caffeine and or sugar or something. If I am sick I feel like I can blame either my family or others at work because there are a 
            few other people out of work because they are sick also.

            On my way back to my apartment I dropped by Trader Joes to get some hold over groceries until I go grocery shopping this weekend. I got a whole bag of oranges and 
            plan to power through it before the end of day on Friday.

            I am starting to formulate a few interesting ideas about social networking at the moment, I have two new core ideas I want to pursue, one directly in social networking 
            and the other only with some small social aspects. Probably won't be able to work on them for a week or more. Really got to get a long weekend in to work them out.
