            I got up a reasonable time this morning, around 5am so I am feeling pretty good about today. I think the plan is to get sushi with
            some of the guys at work for lunch but I am not sure if that is going to happen or not. I kind of still feel quite full from yesterday.

            Lunch was way too filling, we went to this sushi place not 5 minutes from the office, three other co-workers and I. We definitely ordered more
            sushi than we ever really wanted.
          </p>

            I said I was going to write a ton about today, but not sure what else I can go on and on about. Work has been alright, some things have been
            picking up and others have been slowing down.
          </p>

            In terms of my projects outside of work there hasn't been that much going on, mostly just working on this site. As I say before every weekend I
            hope to spend more time working on something else, and hopeully churn out some new projects in the coming weeks.
