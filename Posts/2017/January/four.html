          <h4>The Morning</h4>
          <p>
            It seems like my alarm clock wakes me up earlier and earlier every morning, although I feel like I no longer need to set about 6 alarms from 
            5-5:15 in the morning. I have been really digging the song from Redbone titled <quote>Come and Get Your Love</quote> from the beginning sequence 
            of Guardians of the Galaxy. It just has a really good beat and rhthym.
          </p>
          <p>
            Off to work I go, I guess I could be taking the later trains in, I might experiment with that later this week I guess.
          </p>
          <h4>The Evening</h4>
          <p>
            I need to figure out my meal planning soon as I am going to the grocery store this weekend, I can't keep eating the crappy food I was eating before I 
            took my vacation time. I need to double down on something healthy and stick to it.
