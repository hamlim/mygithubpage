                    So I have been working at Wayfair for a little over a month now, and I wanted to talk a bit about my feelings about web development at a large company. Of course I should probably state that I am not speaking at all for Wayfair, and that my takeaways don't reflect how others at the company feel, probably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I have gotten that notice out of the way, I want to bring up my reasons for feeling like web development sucks. When working on a large well established website such as Wayfair there are three core restrictions that make development a huge pain in the ass. Below is a list of what I believe to be the core restrictions on doing great web development.
                </p>
                <ul class="ul-styled">
                    <li class="li--spacing"><a href="#legacy" class="link">Support for legacy browsers</a></li>
                    <li class="li--spacing"><a href="#teams" class="link">Working with teams greater than 1</a></li>
                    <li class="li--spacing"><a href="#stale" class="link">Code gets old and stale</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="legacy"><u>Support for legacy browsers:</u></h3>
                <p>
                    Support for legacy browsers is by far the absolute worst. If you are also a web developer you probably feel the same way I do about this as well. the best way I can liken this to is being a civil engineer and building a bridge that is going to be driven on 99.5% of the the time by small lightweight cars, and the city tells you that they need to support the 0.5% of traffic that is large box trucks, so you are forced to build an out of date bridge just to allow this small percentage of the population to use the bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing CSS and HTML that supports IE8 is one of the worst things I have to do as a web developer. What makes it even worse is that CSS standards are advancing so quickly that there are all these great new tools to handle layout of webpages that I can't use because one browser happens to not support it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I understand that there is very little that can be done about this, especially because Wayfair as a company needs to offer their platform to as many potential users as possible. My hard takeaway from this though is that this mentality will end up crushing Wayfair and any company doing the same.
                </p>
                <h3 id="teams">
                    <u>Working with teams greater than 1:</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At Wayfair most work is broken down into large groups called Super Pods, and then within each of these are smaller pods generally consisting of about 10-50 employees including PM's, developers, Designers, and others. Being a developer that has to touch code that has been touched by hundreds of developers just in the past month is one of the worst things ever.

                    <p class="escape--default">
                        I can finally see why Git was developed, someone got fed up with their teammate deleting all their work when they copied their code edits to the server. 
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Any size company can try to combat issues with large teams with all the code standards in the world but they will still succumb to issues when hiring new developers. The fact of the matter is that no matter how many standards you have, you will always loose efficiency as you hire more developers past a reasonable amount<sup><a href="#fn1" class="link">1</a></sup>. 
                </p>

                    <u>Code gets old and stale:</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The longer your company or web project lasts, the worse the code library behind it gets. After some amount of time (during which you hire new devs, add new features, and expand the product) you start to spend more time patching than building. Patching is the process of fixing things with old code bases, this involves fixing bugs that arise from new edits to the code, or changes to the platform. 
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                    <p class="escape--default">
                        The goal of web development is to optimize for spending the smallest amount of time patching code and spending the most amount of time on building.

                        Patching, more than building, will destroy a developer.

                <p>
                    Here is my final takeaway, writing code in an environment like this for extended periods of time will end up corrupting the will and spirit of young ambitious developers. Thats a plain fact. The more developers spend bending backwards to support out of date platforms, writing code with 5 engineers for each line, and supporting old code bases, the fewer breakout developers we will see across the globe and the speed of innovation in web development will slow.
