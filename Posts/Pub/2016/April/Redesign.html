                <p>
                    I recently redesigned my entire website for two reasons. The first was that I wanted to try and use a CSS library I have started work on, and the second was because I felt like my current site was a bit chaotic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have written several posts about redesigning certain websites whether they are mine or some other sites, and for most of those writeups I went into the specific design principles or explained the different reasons as to why I used specific things. This writeup will not be like those as I am currently fairly short on time. instead I wanted to talk about a few things that I am using and a few things that I am cutting entirely from the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing that I cut, and not initally by need or want, was any sort of external javascript file. I used to be loading in jQuery and a few external files because I was using things like mustachejs for templates and loading in a ton of data. Now I simply use javascript for Google analytics and thats all. I haven&#39;t done the due diligence of checking load times of my website before the redesign and after the redesign, however I am fairly certain that by removing a ton of the waste the site should be loading faster for a lot of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing I want to add is to talk a bit about what I used for my css. The entire layout is done using <kbd>flexbox</kbd> which made the design part incredibly easy. This of course means that the website will look completely terrible when viewed from browsers that don&#39;t support these css standards, but I am alright with that. I was considering using the Grid Layout CSS features but decided to not use it because only a small number of browsers actually support Grid Layout and I figured it would be easier for me to simply use flexbox. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I said in the beginning I am using a lot of my own CSS / HTML assets. In fact I am only really using Ion Icons and Normalize.css as my external 3rd party resources. I am sure I could have optimized my site more but as it stands now I am fairly happy with how it works and feels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a sidenote, about a month ago I moved all my sites over to Cloudflare in order to setup HTTPS on all my domains. This has been really easy to do and I am happy with how simple it was to actually setup.
