                    2015 was a big year for me, I changed a lot about myself internally, and also the settings around me. I began the year focusing on growing social acceptance in terms of followers, friends, and other online interactions. I changed that mindset only a few weeks ago to instead focus on building a value network around me of trusted friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I focused more on my friendships with others, making sure that I thank those that have been there for me when I needed them the most. I have truly been lucky this year to be able to surround myself in caring and thoughtful friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While looking back on 2015, I also wanted to look forward to 2016. What the new year will offer me I barely know, all I can do is organize my life as much as possible so that I am prepared to take on any new challenges that come my way. In the end that's all we really are able to do, build up our support so that we can bounce back when we get hit hard.

                    In 2016 I want to focus on finishing school and setting up a pathway to a successful life, emphasis on life and not career. I do really want to find a nice job, but I would rather fail at doing something I love than succeed at doing something I hate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want everyone to know that I loved 2015, especially all the time I spent with my friends and family, and I can't wait to kick off 2016!
