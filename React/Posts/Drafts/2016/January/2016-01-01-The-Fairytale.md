I have recently been listening to the Millennial podcast by Megan Tan and team, and I decided to jump right into the podcast by listening to The NYC Fairy Tale. In this episode, Megan talks about how she has been applying to a few jobs here and there by filling out online forms and submitting resumes to companies. As I was listening to started to chuckle because that is exactly what I had been doing and I am still doing over the past two weeks.
