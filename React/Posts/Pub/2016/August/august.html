                    Where to start? There has been 4 months since my last post on my blog here. A lot has changed since that last post. First off I am now located in Boston Massachusetts. (Hopefully I spelled that correctly, I've had really bad luck with spelling it right on the first time). I am working at a company called <a href="http://wayfair.com" class="link link--out link--article">Wayfair</a> (and probably should say that I don't speak for the company at all). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been working as a web developer crushing CSS and HTML bugs, as well as shipping several large new features for Wayfair and it's affiliated brands. While doing this work I have begun to hate web development work, at least work for a large company and brand (<s>I will probably write another post about these feelings.</s> <a href="/Posts/Pub/2016/August/WebDevelopmentSucks.html" class="link link--out link--article">Here</a> is a link to that post.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past few months I have been working on several projects, one for a small startup which will launch soon, another that is coming up for another startup, some small personal projects and mostly searching for work. I haven't been as active as I would have liked with my personal projects, so now I have been focusing on side projects in the evenings and on the weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also been working on revising my diet, I bought <a href="https://www.soylent.com/product/coffiest/" class="link link--out">Coffiest</a> a week or two ago and have been addicted to it since the second one ðŸ˜ƒ. After I began to like that I decided to pull the trigger and bought some <a href="www.spacenutrientsstation.com" class="link link--out link--article">"Space Food"</a>. This stuff is really odd at first but once you get used to it its actually quite interesting. I have begun to replace my lunches at work with simply a cup of powder and some water. Unfortunately I still have a ton of real food in my fridge that I need to go through first before completely switching over.

                <p>
                    The only things I really only need to change are my productivity habits/systems and also starting to get some bodyweight fitness activities into my daily schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on writing a lot more as I have several blog ideas built up over the months that I wasn't writing, so stay tuned for more!
